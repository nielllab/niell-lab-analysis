Psychstim-pc10 uses UDP to convey the condition number and frame synch and stim synch
to the RZ5 in HSE-860 using the UDP shutter control box, 
which has an extra 16 bits of output in addition to the eye shutter control.
The Pinout uses a straight-through DB25 cable and is from 
PortB of the shutter DIO -->  Byte A of RZ5
PortC of the shutter DIO -->  Byte B or RZ5

The only difficult part is that sometimes the shutter box has to be restarted.
Psychstimcontroller restarts it each time it runs.  
It is probably best to leave it unplugged??

The matching TDT program is in pc22:c:\bin\sort_linear_tetrode_RZ5_860
